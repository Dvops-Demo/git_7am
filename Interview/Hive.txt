>Hive is a warehouse component in Hadoop ecosystem.
>It is meant for processing.
>Hive has two types of tables:1 Internal/managed table 2.External table.
 1.Internal table:
   when we drop a table here data will be deleted in hdfs.
 2.External table:
   when we drop a table here data will be still persist in hdfs given location.
>Hive is built on top of hadoop which is an open source framework used to process large datasets.
>Partitioning:
 We go for partitioning when there is high cardinality in data. For eg. if we do partition on location column
 then number of files will be created in a folder based on the no. of locations we have.So that retrieval becomes
 faster.
>Bucketing:
 It is used for organizing the data.
 Bucketing in hive comes helpful when the use of partitioning becomes hard.
>Hive metastore:
 It contains all hive table details, such as its column details,table database,table names.
>How to load the data into hive table?
 We have a syntax as:
 load data inpath "<<location of datafile>>" into table <<give table name>>.
>How to know the information about the table?
 Describe table;
 Describe formatted table;
>CTAS: Create table as select.
>Static partition, Dynamic partition
 Creating the table is same but loading the data differs in static & dynamic.
